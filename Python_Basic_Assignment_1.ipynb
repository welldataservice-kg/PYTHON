        "**1. What is Python, and why is it popular?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Ans- Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is popular because of its vast libraries, versatility, and strong community support across fields like web development, data science, and AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is an interpreter in Python?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "    Ans - An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine-readable instructions.It makes Python easy to test and debug, but generally slower than compiled languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names). Examples include if, else, while, for, def, and class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4.  Can keywords be used as variable names?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because they are reserved for specific syntax and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What is mutability in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans - #objects/container whose state or value can be changed after they are created are called as mutable objects or container, list is a type of mutable object/supports item assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans - **Lists are mutable** because they are designed for dynamic operations like adding, removing, or modifying elements. **Tuples are immutable** to ensure data integrity and allow their use as dictionary keys or set elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans - The **==** operator checks if the values of two objects are equal, even if they are stored in different memory locations. The **is** operator checks whether two references point to the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. What are logical operators in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements. They include and, or, and not.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is type casting in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans -  Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into another.  It can be done using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans - Implicit type casting (type conversion) is done automatically by Python when it promotes a smaller data type to a larger one to avoid data loss.Explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer using functions like int(), float(), or str().\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to execute specific blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.They help in decision-making using if, elif, and else.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. How does the elif statement work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans - The elif statement in Python lets you check multiple conditions after an if. It runs the block of code for the first elif whose condition is true, skipping the rest.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. What is the difference between for and while loops?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans - ChatGPT said:A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known, as it iterates over a sequence or range. A while loop is used when the number of iterations is not fixed and continues until a condition becomes false.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans - A while loop is more suitable when you don’t know in advance how many times the loop should run. For example, repeatedly asking a user for input until they enter a valid password."
